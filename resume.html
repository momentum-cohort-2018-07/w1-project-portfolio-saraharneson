<!--  <p>I grew up in Montclair, New Jersey and moved to Chapel Hill for college. I graduated from UNC with a degree in journalism and English literature. I was the associate art director at the <i>Carolina Alumni Review</i>, and senior art director for <i>Durham Magazine</i>, <i>Chapel Hill Magazine</i>, and <i>Chatham Magazine</i>, and also shot for those publications. I freelance in both design and photography. After a career in print, I'm finally learning to code!</p>

# Build a portfolio site

## Directions

In this homework, you will build a web site about yourself. The website should have:

* A homepage with your picture and some information introducing yourself, as well as links to other places you can be found online.
* A project page that lists your two projects so far and links to them.
* A page showing your resumé in HTML.

Your website should use CSS for layout and semantic HTML for markup. It should be responsive and look good on mobile devices as well as on the desktop. -->
